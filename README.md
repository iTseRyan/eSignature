# Background
This was one of my first angular projects. I was speaking to an employee of the non-profit organization CityKidz. They had mentioned that the permission slip process was very difficult. This was due to the fact that the permissions slips required a signature confirming that parents had reviewed that their information was correct, this required volunteers and employees to go door to door and collect signatures. An alternative method of completing these forms were to send the families a link and speak to them on the phone. This project was shown to the employee and is awaiting a greenlight to continue.

# eSignature
An electronic permission slip.
- Step 1: Fill in information
- Step 2: Click on "continue"
- Step 3: Confirm the information
- Step 4: The information is saved into an image
- Step 5: (Incomplete) Send the image to the permission slip dropbox

# Concepts Practiced
- Utilizing npm component packages
- Displaying DOM elements based on ngIf conditions
- Exploring different ways to export and transfer image files/blob type files
- Experimenting with python flask backend for handling image file transferring via API calls (Currently unimplemented for demo)
- Investigated dropbox API options (Currently unimplemented for demo)
